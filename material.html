        <p>
          What we're looking at: self-contained, standalone applications built using JavaScript. These differ a lot from the more common JavaScript-powered application. Mainly, but not necessarily, they:
          <ul>
            <li>have their own templates.</li>
            <li>send/receive data to/from a server (when they do) via JSON or XML.</li>
            <li>control their own navigation (hashbangs and/or <a href="http://diveintohtml5.org/history.html">pushState</a>).</li>
            <li>separation between data/view layers.</li>
            <li>statefulness.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Key benefits:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Complete front-end independence</em>. The JavaScript application is merely just another client to the service's API.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once you build up the data layer, the rest is very fast to build.
          </li>
          <li>
            Code sharing between client and server is quickly becoming a reality. See <a href="http://andyet.net/blog/2011/feb/15/re-using-backbonejs-models-on-the-server-with-node/">this article</a>. Also, check <a href="http://nowjs.com/">now.js</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>NOT DOM ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT.</em>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It's essential is that whatever you build should not suck. Apply whatever approach
          works best given what you're trying to achieve.

      <section id="our-app">
        <h1>II. Our application</h1>
        <p>The main objective in our workshop is understanding how <a href="https://github.com/juliocesar/Listie">Listie</a> works.</p>
        <p>
          The app looks simple enough, but it illustrates a bunch of common use cases, such
          as navigation, view inheritance, collection associations, and preloading data
          from a server.
        </p>
        <p>
          Go nuts! Clone it, read the source. <em>Write an app based on of it</em>. No amount of
          explanation can replace that.

      <section id="backbone-models">
        <h1>III. Backbone: Models</h1>
        <p>
          They're 50% of your data layer. The other 50% are
          <a href="#backbone-collections">collections</a>. A model is what gives your JavaScript
          awareness of what it's dealing when it comes to raw data. Instead of manipulating
          pure JavaScript objects carrying properties and values, you got domain logic.
        </p>
        <p>For instance:</p>
        <pre><code>List = Backbone.Model.extend({
  initialize : function() {
    var self = this;
    if (!(self.get('items'))) self.set({ 'items': [] }, { silent: true });
    _.bindAll(self, 'updateItems');
    self.Items = new Items;
    self.Items.bind('reset',  self.updateItems);
    self.Items.bind('add',    self.updateItems);
    self.Items.bind('remove', self.updateItems);
  },

  url : function() { return this.isNew() ? '/lists' : '/lists/' + this.id; },

  updateItems : function() {
    this.set({ items : this.Items.map(function(item) { return item.get('name'); }) });
  }
});</code></pre>
      <p>Methods declared in <code>extend</code> will exist in all instances.</p>
      <p>
        Models don't need collections to exist! There might be cases where you really just
        want one. E.g.: application settings could be kept in a single model.
      </p>
      </section>

      <section id="backbone-collections">
        <h1>IV. Backbone: Collections</h1>
        <p>
          Collections are groups of models (duh). Ok, they're not just that. They're also another
          control mechanism that helps you bind stuff that happens to your data so you can get
          what's on the screen to react to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of printing arrays directly to the screen, you bind methods to certain events
          fired when certain things happen to your collection. For instance, `add` gets triggered
          when a model gets added. Common Backbone use case: rendering an entry on the screen
          when that happens.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe multiple parts of our interface might be interested in updates when a single
          collection gets updated. Hence tying everything together with events keeps everything
          nice and decoupled.
        </p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <pre><code>Lists = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  url : '/lists',

  initialize : function() {
    var self = this;
    Listie.User.bind('change:lists', function(user, lists) { self.reset(lists); });
  }
});</code></pre>
      </section>
      <section id="backbone-views">
        <h1>V. Views</h1>
        <p>
          Backbone views are weird, because they're not views in the same sense that MVC views
          are (templates). They're another JavaScript class that defines the presentation
          behaviour. As in, for example, what happens when you click an element.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two basic types of views we'll see: views whose purpose is to present
          one element in a collection, and views that act like components in the screen. Usually,
          but not always, the former is tied to collection events, and the latter to user-triggered
          events.
        </p>
        <p>Example of a model view:</p>
        <pre><code>var ItemView = CheckBoxListView.extend({
  template  : _.template($('#list-item-template').html()),

  check : function() {
    Listie.Creator.calculateSelected();
  }
});</code></pre>
      <p>It inherits from a class I defined elsewhere called <code>CheckBoxListView</code>:</p>
      <pre><code>var CheckBoxListView = Backbone.View.extend({
  tagName   : 'li',
  events  : {
    'click input' : 'check'
  },

  initialize : function() {
    _.bindAll(this, 'remove');
    this.model.bind('remove', this.remove);
    this.model.view = this;
  },

  render : function() {
    $(this.el).html(this.template(this.model.toJSON()));
    return this;
  }
});</code></pre>
      <p>
        Note how Backbone just hands you a cool inheritance mechanism that Just Worksâ„¢.
      </p>
      <p>
        As described before, we also have views that control "areas" of our interface. Check
        <a href="https://github.com/juliocesar/Listie/blob/master/public/js/lists.js#L34">on GitHub</a>
        the source for the lists browser.
      </p>
      </section>
      <section id="backbone-routes">
        <h1>VI. Backbone: Routes and Navigation</h1>
        <p>
          Backbone carries a `Router` class which we can use for creating the states that our application's
          interface will have. If you look at how we did the screens for Listie, you'll notice that they're
          all hidden by default.
        </p>
        <p>We declare our "URLs", like so:</p>
        <pre><code>Router = Backbone.Router.extend({
  routes : {
    ''            : 'newList',
    '/'           : 'newList',
    '/browse'     : 'browse',
    '/account'    : 'account',
    '/lists/:id'  : 'show',
    '/sign-out'   : 'signOut'
  },</code></pre>
        <p>
          If you look at <a href="https://github.com/juliocesar/Listie/blob/master/views/application.erb#L90">the bottom</a>
          of our <code>views/application.erb</code> template, you'll notice we're calling <code>Backbone.history.start()</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          That will basically kick-start our routes. Going to to the root URL for our application, the router will then look
          for a method called <code>newList</code> and execute it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meaning, this is where you should put that sort of thing. Any triggers related to showing/hiding screens or parts of
          it should live here.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="css3-and-navigation">
        <h1>CSS3 and Navigation</h1>
        <p>
          There's way more to CSS3 animations other than cool effects. Not that it needed to to be worth mentioning, anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
          CSS3 is hardware accelerated on most modern phones and browsers. Which makes it the perfect tool for large screen transitions.
          JavaScript is just about catching up with
          <a href="http://paulirish.com/2011/requestanimationframe-for-smart-animating/">requestAnimationFrame</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the context of applications, there is one specific property of interest: <code>(-webkit/-moz/-o/-transition)</code>.
          Setting the transition property on an element determines how the element will react to changes made to that property.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that with every screen transition in listie, there's an animation that follows with it where it slides from
          the left to the right, along with the opacity. That's done with
          <a href="https://github.com/juliocesar/Listie/blob/master/public/css/screen.css#L122">this setting</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          By setting making all <code>section</code>s, invisible by default, and only a setting with class <code>current</code>
          visible, we can effectively switch screens by controlling who has that class at any one time.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="performance">
        <h1>Performance</h1>
        <p>
          Performance in web applications is (almost) all about perceived performance. A well architected application will progressively
          add itself to the screen in a way that it keeps the user entertained or paying attention, effectively reducing the impression
          that it's slow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Don't get me wrong: you still need to do things right and avoid any kind of stupid decision that would heavily impact
          the application's load time.
        </p>
        <p>
          One resource that we can use is a loader. A loader will, in a nutshell, load your scripts asynchronously and in parallel (not
          as a rule though). I used <a href="http://yepnopejs.com/">yepnope.js</a> for Listie, simply because it's easy to use, it's
          API is nice, and it integrates well with <a href="http://www.modernizr.com/">Modernizr</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          With yepnope, we can also be declarative about how our app loads. If you read
          <a href="https://github.com/juliocesar/Listie/blob/master/views/application.erb#L65">the code towards the end</a> of your
          application template, it pretty much explains itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Don't forget: <em>test</em> things, measure outcomes. A loader might yield worst results than bundling your JavaScripts together.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="html5-apis">
        <h1>HTML5 APIs</h1>
        <p>
          There's a whole bunch of new JavaScript APIs in HTML5. The two most reliable and practical are
          <a href="http://diveintohtml5.org/geolocation.html">geolocation</a> and
          <a href="http://diveintohtml5.org/storage.html">localStorage</a>. Yeah, there's also WebSockets, but things are looking weird
          still as far as browser support goes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Geolocation gives you reliable-ish positioning info, which often gets sent in HTTP requests so the server can use that info
          to give you results that take your location into consideration (see the demo application).
        </p>
        <p>
          It's not a direct port or anything, but in the absence of this feature, you can always use the
          <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/geocoding/">Google Geocoding API</a>. It's rarely a good idea to
          geocode stuff on the server-side.
        </p>
        <p>
          localStorage is a personal sweetheart of mine. It allows for a totally different and desirable way of doing things: you
          develop your app down to the data level to operate locally, and only sync with the server on command or certain intervals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Adding items to a list in Listie happens locally. The feedback when adding is instant. It also makes a lot of sense
          for applications that don't need to submit data to a server at all.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="mobile">
        <h1>Mobile JavaScript Apps</h1>
        <p>
          The self-contained model works really well for mobile applications. People like when a mobile web application looks
          and feels fast and familiar. Clever use of <a href="http://diveintohtml5.org/offline.html">HTML5 Manifest</a> caching
          means you <em>can</em> deliver an experience as good as a native application.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don't know how come not many people have kicked a fuss over it, but the
          <a href="https://github.com/madrobby/zepto/tree/master/examples/iphone">iPhone example</a> in 
          <a href="http://zeptojs.com/">Zepto.js</a>'s source is absolutely kick-ass. Smack Backbone on top of that and you have
          a suite better/faster/hotter than jQuery Mobile.
        </p>
        <p>
          The example is not dependant on Zepto. As a matter of fact the biggest deal in it is the CSS, and how clean it allows
          the markup to be. Compared to the crazy nesting you're forced to do with jQuery Mobile, it's heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          Speaking of Zepto, do check it out. It's a worse jQuery, in a nutshell, but it performs way better in Webkit-powered
          handsets and tablets, as it's aimed at these devices, rather than concerning itself with abstracting IE dumbness.
        </p>

      <section id="testing">
        <h1>Testing</h1>
        <p>
          Testing JavaScript <em>libraries</em> is easy. Testing <em>JavaScript-heavy products</em> is not. It's getting easier
          though, but still far from ideal.
        </p>
        <p>
          The test suite becomes huge <em>very</em> fast. It becomes slow even faster, thanks to all the waiting time involved
          in navigation switching, DOM manipulation, and whatnot.
        </p>
        <p>
          The one suite I'll recommend is <a href="http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/">Jasmine</a>. I will however recommend
          that you strive to keep your code well-structured. It'll save you from needing to test a lot of stuff. There. I said it.
